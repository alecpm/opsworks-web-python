description      "Recipes for a modular scalable deployment of Plone on AWS OpsWorks."
long_description  "This plone deployment recipe expects a modular buildout config structure with most parts defined in cfg/base.cfg, along with instance configuration in cfg/instances.cfg and relstorage instances in cfg/relstorage_instances.cfg.  It makes many assumptions about the buildout structure (clients are named client${n}, zeo port is hardcoded to 8001, etc.).  It supports ZEO or RelStorage deployments with separate DB and instance servers.  It supports Celery + Redis integration, Memcached integration with RelStorage, as well as Solr integration.  It supports automated backup and packing of ZEO servers and automated packing of RelStorage"
